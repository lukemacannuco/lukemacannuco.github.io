            <h1>Jayson Tatum's 2024-2025 Season, So Far</h1>
            <p>Jayson Tatum, the defacto star of the reigning NBA Champions, the Boston Celtics, has been having another great season. Let's take a look at the breakdown of his work on the court.</p>

            <h2>Tatum's season, by the numbers</h2>
            <p>Tatum has been having a strong individual 2024-2025 season, as evidenced by his statistical averages. He leads the Celtics in:</p>
            <ul><li>Points per game (PPG), with 26.8</li>
            <li>Rebounds per game (RPG), with 8.8</li>
            <li>Assists per game (APG), with 5.7</li></ul>
            <p>These statistics were acquired on 2/23/25 via <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/player/jayson-tatum-9582">StatMuse</a>.</p>

            <h2>Tatum's impact on the team</h2>
            <p>Tatum's leadership has led to the Celtics having another high-winning season. The team is third place overall in league standings, the top 5 teams being:</p>
            <ol><li>Cleveland Cavaliers, 46-10 (.821 win%)</li>
            <li>Oklahoma City Thunder, 45-10 (.818 win%)</li>
            <li>Boston Celtics, 41-16 (.719 win%)</li>
            <li>Memphis Grizzlies, 37-19 (.661 win%)</li>
            <li>Denver Nuggets, 37-20 (.649 win%)</li></ol>
            <p>These statistics were acquired on 2/23/25 via the NBA's <a href="https://www.nba.com/standings">official webpage</a>.</p>

            <h2>Looking ahead for Tatum's Celtics</h2>
            <p>Though first place in the Eastern Conference is likely out of reach for Jayson Tatum and the Boston Celtics, they still have a strong hold on second place and are well positioned for the NBA Playoffs. Last season, the Celtics only lost three games in their journey to an NBA Championship. This year's playoffs will likely be tougher, with formidable opponents in the Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks, but with Tatum healthy and performing well, the Boston Celtics must be feeling good about their chances.</p>
