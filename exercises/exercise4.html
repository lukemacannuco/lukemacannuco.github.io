            <h2>Reporting on ValleyBikes</h2>
            <p>I have reported on ValleyBikes for the Massachusetts Daily Collegian; this image could go alongside a copy of that reporting.</p>

            <h2>Reporting on 2024 primary elections</h2>
            <p>As part of my work reporting for the Harvard Press, I reported on the 2024 Democratic and Republican primary elections in town. This image could be used to go alongside a copy of that reporting, as well.</p>

            <h2>Writing Center work</h2>
            <p>I am proud of my work as a tutor intern (and hopefully, paid tutor next year) at the UMass Writing Center. This image could go alongside a description of the details of that work, including both courses and time spent in the Center.</p>
