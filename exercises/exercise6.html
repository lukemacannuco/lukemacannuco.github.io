        <h1>About the writer, Luke Macannuco:</h1>

        <h2>My studies</h2>
        <p>I am currently a junior journalism major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am also pursuing a Certificate of Professional Writing and Technical Communication. My journalistic interests include investigative journalism, arts and entertainment journalism, and general watchdog reporting.</p>

        <h2>My work</h2>
        <p> In my time as a student journalist, I have written for the Goucher College Quindecim in the Arts and Entertainment and News sections and the Massachusetts Daily Collegian in the News, Arts and Living, and Opinion-Editorial sections. Outside of student media, I worked as a reporting intern for the Harvard Press, a small local newspaper based in Harvard, Massachusetts, where I covered local politics. I am also a tutoring intern at the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/writing-center/">University of Massachusetts Amherst Writing Center</a>, where I tutor undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty on their writing. Check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-macannuco-37498a2b2/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="mailto:lukemacannuco@gmail.com">email me</a> with any inquiries!</p>
