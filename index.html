                <p>I am a writer and journalism student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from Winchester, MA. My writing has been featured in the Massachusetts Daily Collegian, UMassâ€™s independent student newspaper where I am a staff writer, and the Harvard Press, a weekly newspaper out of Harvard, MA, where I was a reporting intern. This summer, I will be working as a news intern for the Greenfield Recorder, a daily newspaper that serves the entirety of Franklin County, MA. In the future, I hope to work in the journalism industry, where my passions are narrative journalism and creative-nonfiction.
